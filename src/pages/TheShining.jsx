                okay so this is a book i really like a lot.
                this books talks about a little kid called Dany and his family who stay in a haunted hotel called The Overlook.
                This is horror story but the most terrifying things are not the usual ghosts or spirits you get in such books
                it's the tragedy of how we tend to become exactly what we decided not to be. In moments of anger we tend to do 
                things which we were soo sure we won't ever do. Jack, Danny's father is so sure that he'll be a great dad, always 
                always loving his child and never ever beating him, but somehow once he does, and i can't even imagine how devastating
                it was for him to realize he has become what he never wanted to be
                anyway, there is a lot more to the story then this, it's soo well written and thoughtful, maybe you should give it a shot too!!!
